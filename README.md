Tired of switching tabs to copy OTPs from your email? This Chrome extension automatically fetches OTPs from your inbox and fills them in for youâ€”just like SMS OTPs on your phone, but for desktop.

Log in once, sit back, and let the extension handle the rest! 

- Currently supports Gmail
- Login via the extension, and grab your OTP at a click of a button
